Heart Disease Prediction Analysis:
This repository contains a project that utilizes the Heart Disease dataset to build and evaluate classification models. The primary focus is to predict heart disease using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Classifiers, both with and without Bagging.

Project Overview:
Data Loading: Imported and cleaned the dataset.
Preprocessing: Removed outliers, encoded text columns, and scaled features.
Model Building: Implemented SVM and Decision Tree classifiers, both standalone and with Bagging.
Evaluation: Compared the performance of different models to assess the impact of Bagging.
